LIRI, it's like iPhone's SIRI, but better. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI takes in the following commands:
my-tweets
spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
movie-this '<movie name here>'
